## About FluxEngine

Welcome to FluxLog, the development blog documenting the creation of **FluxEngine** - a modern game engine built from scratch using C++ and Vulkan.

## What is FluxEngine?

FluxEngine is an ambitious indie game engine project that aims to:

- Provide a modern, efficient graphics pipeline using Vulkan
- Implement clean, maintainable C++ architecture
- Support cross-platform development
- Offer powerful tools for indie game developers

## The Journey

This blog chronicles the entire development process, from initial language selection debates to complex graphics programming challenges. You'll find:

- **Technical Deep Dives**: Detailed explanations of engine architecture decisions
- **Development Updates**: Regular progress reports and feature implementations  
- **Lessons Learned**: Honest reflections on what works (and what doesn't)
- **Code Examples**: Practical implementation details and snippets

## About the Developer
