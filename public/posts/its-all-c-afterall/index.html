        <blockquote>
<p>In the beginning, there was chaos…</p></blockquote>
<p>… and from this chaos emerged a whole bunch of wrong decisions, mistakes, and failures that eventually turned into FluxEngine.</p>
<p>In this blog, I’m going to show how a simple intern managed to start creating an engine… instead of accidentally deleting the production DB.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to build a game engine,<br>
so all the dudes on the internet telling me <em>“build games, not game engines”</em>… well, they sucked for me.</p>
<p>Game engine architecture is clear, complex, and looks <strong>sexy af</strong>.<br>
Meanwhile, game code looks by definition like <strong>spaghetti on top of more spaghetti</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s not the developers’ fault – sometimes art requires moving your code into the hacky realm of quick fixes and rewrites on demand.</p>
<p>The engine, however, is the place for the technologically gifted (or introverted enough to spend all their life in front of a PC).</p>
<p>And game engine code is the one place where <strong>no designer or artist can hurt you</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first very important question I had to solve was: <strong>what language am I going to use?</strong></p>
<p>So I did the worst thing you can do in that position – I asked Reddit.<br>
Oh boy. If only I knew what kind of mistake that was.</p>
<p><img src="/images/openheimer.png" alt="Me after posting the question"><br>
<em>Me after posting the question</em></p>
<p>Ok, but let’s cut the crap. After a couple of minutes, I had a list of candidates:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>C</strong> – almighty C, some say it can compile on a potato. Very verbose and ideal in its own way. The problem? It’s <em>too</em> simple. For some that’s a plus, but I wanted to learn new stuff. Also, my previous game engine attempt was already in C, so I wanted something else.</li>
<li><strong>Zig</strong> – another great possibility. The trendy, modern, safe low-level kid on the block. But it’s not stable. Even tiny version bumps break the build system and core concepts entirely. Not something I want for a long-term project.</li>
<li><strong>Odin</strong> – yet another new kid. I haven’t tried it (yet), but it’s compiled with a C ABI, so in theory it’s more stable than Zig. Supposedly “finished” too, at least according to its author. Maybe one day.</li>
<li><strong>Rust</strong> – my second failed attempt. I tried to learn it, but stopped when I discovered (maybe mistakenly) that making static libs or DLLs requires going through C. My thought was: if in the end it’s all C anyway, what’s the point?</li>
<li><strong>C++</strong> – last but not least. Basically C with extra toys. My plan: use C-style C++ for the low-level guts, and modern C++ for the abstract stuff. I actually built an engine in C++ back in middle school, on OpenGL. I didn’t know what I was doing, but hey – this time I’ve got Vulkan.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>So yeah, after all the drama, I went with <strong>C++</strong>.<br>
Because in the end… <strong>everything is C anyway.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/itsallc.png" alt="It&rsquo;s all C"></p>
<p>Next time I’ll talk about actually setting up the damn project,<br>
because (spoiler) <strong>CMake is pain in the ass. As always.</strong></p>
<p>See you soon</p>
