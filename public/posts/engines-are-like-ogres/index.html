<p>In the beginning, there was chaos…</p></blockquote>
<p>… and from this chaos emerged a whole bunch of wrong decisions, mistakes, and failures that eventually turned into FluxEngine.</p>
<p>In this blog, I’m going to show how a simple intern managed to start creating an engine… instead of accidentally deleting the production DB.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to build a game engine,<br>
so all the dudes on the internet telling me &ldquo;build games, not game engines&rdquo;… well, they sucked for me.</p>
<p>Game engine architecture is clear, complex, and looks <strong>sexy af</strong>.<br>
Meanwhile, game code looks by definition like <strong>spaghetti on top of more spaghetti</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s not the developers’ fault – sometimes art requires moving your code into the hacky realm of quick fixes and rewrites on demand.</p>
<p>The engine, however, is the place for the technologically gifted (or introverted enough to spend all their life in front of a PC).</p>
<p>And game engine code is the one place where <strong>no designer or artist can hurt you</strong>.</p>
<p>The first very importent question ive decidet to solve wwas what language im gonna use.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve did the worst you can do in that position i&rsquo;ve asked reddit oh boy, if i knew what kind of mistaked i made</p>
<p><img src="/images/openheimer.png" alt="Me after posting the question">
*Me after posting the question</p>
<p>Ok but lets cut the crap. After couple of minuts i ve had couple of languages</p>
<ol>
<li>C - allmighty C some say it can compile on potato. Very verbose and ideal but the problem is its really simple
for some its a plus for me i want to learn new stuff so i didnt choose C, additionaly my previous game engine attempt was using C
so i wannted to use something else.</li>
<li>Zig - another great possiblity new kid on the block trendy modren safe low level, one problem remains its not stable, when i tried to
setup a project ive discovered that verey small version of zig changes build system and core concepts entierly thats not gonna land for me with long project
i could stop on this version that currently is available but i dont like that</li>
<li>Odin - another great example of new kid on the block i didnt tried it maybe im gonna do some stuff on it since if i recall coractly its compiled using C ABI
as my last choice, its better than zig since its supposed to be finished at least thats what i heard from author</li>
<li>Rust - my second faild project it was different i tried to learn rust and i stopped when i discovered (maybe mistakely) than it doesnt give static lib and dll posibility without externing to c and compiling down to C, i really disliked that approach my mind was wondering whats the point of using rust if at the end it will be C,</li>
<li>C++ - The last but not least it is C and it has somem ore complex stuff which i wouldl ike to try, my plan is to build lower level stuff using C-style of C++ and more abstract stuff in more modern C++, I&rsquo;ve already did enginev in C++ when i was in middleschool but that was long time ago, i didnt knew what I was doing its was build upon OpenGl and now im trying to polish my Vlukan.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hence I chosen c++</p>
